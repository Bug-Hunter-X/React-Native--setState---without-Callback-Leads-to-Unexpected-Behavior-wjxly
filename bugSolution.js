The correct way to update the state is shown below:
```javascript
this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
```
By using a callback function with the previous state, we guarantee that we are working with the most up-to-date version of state. This prevents race conditions and ensures that state updates are applied correctly.
