This React Native code uses a deprecated method for setting the state. The `setState` method should be used with a callback function to ensure that the state update is based on the most recent state. Otherwise, it could lead to unexpected behavior.  Here's the incorrect code:
```javascript
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
```
This can lead to issues where the state update is overwritten. The correct code is shown below.
